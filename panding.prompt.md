Parallelly Start with Module 8 Developmet
<!-- Module 8 Errors Prompt Start -->
Next-Step: (Module 8 Development)
You are instructed to proceed with Module 8 (UI and UX) for both Mobile and Web platforms without waiting for further user confirmation.

You must strictly follow this execution flow:
Plan → Status / Next Steps → Implementation → Review → Testing

Guidelines:
- Each phase must be clearly structured and documented before moving to the next.
- Treat this as an autonomous execution task.
- Use all relevant reference documentation files (e.g., *.md files) available in the /docs folder as the primary source of requirements, standards, and context.
- Ensure production-level UI/UX quality, consistency, and best practices across mobile and web.
- Use proper card sections and data good visualization 
- After completing each phase, clearly summarize outcomes and readiness for the next phase.

- If required Prepare **required sample / dummy / reference data**.sql in /db/sample-data/ and related ***.sh in /scripts/ files as well

Note: Maintain production level development
   - Maintain and use reuasable functionality/scripts at gobal level
   - Maintain existing tap-nav, bottom-nav, buttons-styles
   - Explain what can i do from my side stem-wise
<!-- Module 8 Errors Prompt end -->

Bottom-Nav: (Maintain minimum 4 menus for every user-role)
   - CS-Login:
      - Add CS Dashboard icon/menu insted of top-nav(remove cs dashboard at top-nav)

Common: (Web + Mobile)   
   - Use "floating buttons (FABs)" buttons for existing/new(screens) forms which is Add/New records (Mobile ONLY)


Need to test ...

"If you want, I can add a full Saved management section on web (saved list + badge toggle) to match mobile." Yes Please

Parallelly complete the bellow profile related development
<!-- Profile prompt start -->
Profile: (Suggest me any other profile content)

You must strictly follow this execution flow: (Profile)
Plan → Status / Next Steps → Implementation → Review → Testing
- Ensure production-level UI/UX quality, consistency, and best practices across mobile and web.
- Use proper card sections and data good visualization 
- After completing each phase, clearly summarize outcomes and readiness for the next phase.

- Add profile image (camera/gallery)
- Update personal information like full-name, phone-number, email and address
- Toggles To control show counts of Saved, List and Reqs like (Notifications-count)
   Ex.Saved Count - On/Off, List Count - On/Off Reqs Count - On/Off
- Share / Promote App from social media(WhatsApp, Facebook, etc.)
- Logout

**Database & Testing Support**
   - If requires create db-migrations
   - If requires prepare **required sample / dummy / reference data**.
   - Provide these data inserts as **module-wise `.sql` files**.
   - Prepare **.sh files to easy migrate/upload data
<!-- Profile prompt end -->

Mobile:
- Post Requirement screen should be bottom-nav check with all screens till now designed wether bottom-nav or not

- Botton-nav want to show count of Saved-items like (Notifications-count) each user can control with visible-or-not-from-profile -> toggle buttons

Error:
- One user(buyer1@example.com) Seved items/properties are showing another user(CS1@example.com)

Note:
- Saved item/property should be different for every user

Error: Fix the "Bottom overflowed by *** pixels" for many/all screens
=====================================================
Next Step:
- Proceed with Module 5 (UI and UX) for both mobile and web 
- Don't wait for my confirmation just doit with following manner
- Plan -> Status/Next-Steps -> Implementation -> Review -> Testing

Note: Your reference files(ex. ***.md) are in /docs/ folder

**Database & Testing Support**
   - For each module, prepare **required sample / dummy / reference data**.
   - Provide these data inserts as **module-wise `.sql` files**.
   - The SQL should be realistic enough to test real-time application behavior.
   - I will manually update the database using these SQL files to validate functionality.

Your responsibility is to REVIEW, RESTRUCTURE (if required), FIX, and PRODUCTION-HARDEN
Module 4 (My Listing / Create Listing) using ADVANCED UI ARCHITECTURE
for both Web (React) and Mobile (Flutter).

==================================================
ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES (MANDATORY)
==================================================
• Follow clean architecture and separation of concerns
• UI must be modular, reusable, and scalable
• Business logic must NOT live inside UI widgets/components
• Follow platform best practices:
  - Web: container/presenter pattern, hooks, memoization
  - Mobile: MVVM / Clean Architecture (UI → ViewModel → Service)
• Fix root causes, not surface symptoms
• Minimize rework and avoid breaking changes
• Ensure performance, accessibility, and maintainability

==================================================
GLOBAL RULES
==================================================
• Work strictly within the existing codebase
• Do NOT redesign visuals unless required for correctness or UX
• Identify ROOT CAUSES before coding
• Use clean, scalable, production-ready patterns
• No hardcoded values, no temporary hacks
• Ensure behavior is consistent across ALL devices
• Verify fixes through real execution flows

- Proceed with Module 3 (UI and UX) for both mobile and web 
- Don't wait for my confirmation just doit with following manner
- Plan -> Status/Next-Steps -> Implementation -> Review -> Testing

Note:
- Update Roadmap for every development / implementaion

**Database & Testing Support**
   - For each module, prepare **required sample / dummy / reference data**.
   - Provide these data inserts as **module-wise `.sql` files**.
   - The SQL should be realistic enough to test real-time application behavior.
   - I will manually update the database using these SQL files to validate functionality.

Implement standard mobile UX features:
- Pull-to-refresh
- Loading, empty, and error states
- Offline handling with retry
- Session persistence and route protection
- Pagination / infinite scroll
Ensure features follow production-level mobile UX practices.

Begin with root-cause analysis, then apply verified fixes.
