You are a senior mobile application developer.

Task:
If a user's phone has Developer Mode enabled, show a security alert notification when the app is opened.

Requirements:
1. Detect whether Developer Options / Developer Mode is enabled on the device.
2. Trigger the check immediately when the app launches.
3. If Developer Mode is ON:
   - Show an alert dialog or notification warning the user.
   - Message example: 
     "Security Alert: Developer Mode is enabled on your device. For better security, please disable it."
4. If Developer Mode is OFF:
   - Do nothing and continue normal app flow.
5. The implementation must be production-ready and secure.

Technical Expectations:
- Write complete working code.
- Add clear, professional comments explaining every important line.
- Follow best practices and clean architecture.
- Mention platform-specific handling if required (Android / iOS).
- If Flutter is used, show platform channel implementation where necessary.

Output Format:
1. Short explanation of the approach
2. Full source code
3. Well-commented code
4. Notes about limitations or security considerations
